I left for Pakistan on 29th November at 10:30 AM for my flight at 3:35 PM. engulfed in confusion and anxiety, I was mostly worried about all the chocolated Im travelling with, 3 new smart watches and eventually if Marium's iPhone will reach on time and safely to Pakistan from Mohib. Qandeel Bhai dropped me at the airport at 11:00 AM and I was quickly processed and checked in for the flight. I reached the departure gate at 11:30 AM and it was at this moment I realized I was way too early. Nevertheless, I had to do something that I despise: writing a statement of purpose. Since it was last day for Marium's application, I had to put up a skeleton that she had to complete and she did it way too good.

Eventually, my flight departed on time and I reached montreal, sat in National Bank Lounge on my Qatar Silver Card. Ate some vegetarian food and left for the gate soon afterwards. Priority Boarding is really good because seriously, waiting in line is a pain in the a**. (Im thinking noone will see this article). Anyways, I boarded the plane and unfortunately, I was surrounded by babies. The family behind my seat had 2 kids and when I wanted to sleep and slant my sear, she told me not to since her kid was sleeping in her arms. So I addressed that I wanted to sleep and sleeping upright is uncomfortable. So I switched seats with her husband and slept. While sleeping the really old man to my right just pulled the blanket from me in the middle of the sleep. Like Seriouslly!!?? So I ignored it because he seemed in his 80s and I didnt wanna look like an immoral person. I grabbed his new blanket and spread it across me. Soon after that I could feel someone pressing against my leg and I opened my eyes to see and BAM! The old uncle curled his legs and sleeping on his side facing towards me and pressing my leg with his knee. I adjusted my leg in a slightly uncomfortable position and slept. When I woke up, I felt congested in the middle seat and I wanted to sit in the aisle so I asked the man who switched seat with me to switch it back. Now Dobby is Free and I did not wanna sleep either. I just killed some time and after 4 hours we landed at Doha.

I bought some cool stuff from Qatar Duty Free for free because I accumulate points and that was great and I boarded the last flight to Islamabad and entered Pakistan. So I immediatly opened my bags and distributed everything. I slept at 4:30 AM and woke up at 9:00 AM. I booked an appointment with the massage centre in Islamabad Club and went there at 10:00 AM and also had my breakfast. Afterwards, I came home and left for some shopping with my mom. Just when I reached G-10 for some clothes, Baba asked for the car and we went to pick him up which took some and then we went to Dera for Moeed's Aqeeqa Venue and then to Centaurus where I have decided to buy Bareeze Waistcoat. When I came home, Marium's Ami came and dropped some stack for nikah dress. (50000 pkr ;)) But the envelope was really cute aand a memento. Here have a look at it.
