<h2>Smart Sketch Application: Sketchinator</h2>

This Smart Sketch Application was developed as part of an initiative to help children develop their creativity. The pilot project at NUST Creative School for children was successful in engaging school-going children with artistic activities. Upon further research, the parents reported the children had increased interest in arts. The project used a feedback mechanism to reinforce score to help children draw and visualize objects better. The underlying system used resnet34 as the deep learning architecture to infer sketch with was trained on TU-Berlin dataset. The demonstration of the video can be seen below
