description: Developed various PoC and production devices to recognize activities using audio with inference on microcontrollers. Used Tensorflow-Lite, Pytorch, Arduino Nano BLE Sense 33, Qeexo, Edge Impulse, STM32 ARM M4 to develop our prototypes. Eventually, the project attracted various investors and grants to deploy them in hospitals and old homes. The project recognized major spatial activities including Knock, Water Tap, Flush, Coughing, Fall, Sneeze, Noise, Scream, Help among other activities with 91% accuracy.
