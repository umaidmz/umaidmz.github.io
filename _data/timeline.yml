  description: I hold a professional degree characterized by a rigorous curriculum encompassing a wide range of subjects including machine learning,
               deep learning, statistics, data visualizations, exploratory data analysis, and big data. In addition to the theoretical knowledge, 
               the program also included a cooperative education component, allowing for practical, hands-on experience.

               During this co-op segment, I had the opportunity to work at Huawei Technologies Co., where I was engaged as a Machine Learning Engineer.
              This role provided me with invaluable real-world experience and a deeper understanding of the practical applications of machine learning 
              in the tech industry. More details about my experiences and contributions at Huawei can be found in the following section..

  description: From May through August, I dedicated my efforts to developing an innovative audio anonymization
               solution tailored for automotive clients. This project culminated in the creation of a Java-based
               lightweight application designed to strip voices of any personally identifiable characteristics. 
               By altering voice signatures to sound unrecognizable, the application significantly enhances privacy, 
               addressing the vulnerability of in-car communications. In vehicles, where phone calls and meetings are 
               often at risk of interception by attackers, this solution plays a crucial role in safeguarding confidential 
               information. For a more detailed exploration of this project, please refer to my blog.
