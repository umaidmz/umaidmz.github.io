  description: I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in Pakistan. 
              This academic journey marked the beginning of my deep dive into the expansive world of computing. It was here that I developed a keen interest in a variety of fields such as computer vision, databases, and software engineering. This program not only provided me with a solid foundation
               in theoretical concepts but also equipped me with practical skills and knowledge, setting the stage for my 
               future endeavors in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of computer science.

  from: 2021
  to: 2023
  description: I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence characterized by a rigorous curriculum encompassing a wide range of subjects including machine learning,
               deep learning, statistics, data visualizations, exploratory data analysis, and big data. In addition to the theoretical knowledge, 
               the program also included a cooperative education component, allowing for practical, hands-on experience.

               During this co-op segment, I had the opportunity to work at Huawei Technologies Co., where I was engaged as a Machine Learning Engineer.
              This role provided me with invaluable real-world experience and a deeper understanding of the practical applications of machine learning 
              in the tech industry. More details about my experiences and contributions at Huawei can be found in the following section.

  from: 2022
  to: 2022
  description: From January 2022 to March 2022, I spearheaded a comprehensive analysis of the social media impact on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), 
              revealing pivotal correlations between online activities and trends in the NFT market. This crucial discovery offered
               stakeholders vital insights, aiding them in strategizing their investments and effectively capitalizing on market
                fluctuations. To support this analysis, I engineered sophisticated data wrangling tools that automated the collection 
                of social media data, thereby boosting data acquisition and management efficiency by 16%. Furthermore, I revolutionized our data 
                storage and retrieval processes by implementing an automated pipeline. This system efficiently consolidated social media data into 
                MongoDB, leading to a substantial 60% increase in storage efficiency.This enhancement not only improved query performance but also significantly optimized overall business operations.

  to: 2023
  description: From Feb 2022 to April 2023, I played a leading role in the machine learning team, focusing on the development of an on-device
               spatial audio recognition system. This innovative system boasts an impressive 91% accuracy rate in detecting human activities,
              which has notably improved emergency response times by 40%. A key part of my work involved automating data processing pipelines.
               This was critical for managing the large influx of device payload data in CosmosDB. My approach ensured the availability of
              high-quality data for on-premises machine learning model training, while simultaneously addressing privacy concerns by eliminating 
              the need for data export. Additionally, I was instrumental in developing prototypes that utilized AutoML pipelines, leveraging platforms 
              like Qeexo and Edge Impulse. This facilitated the seamless integration of machine learning models and firmware onto edge devices, sparking 
              significant investor interest and leading to the initiation of a pilot project with global clients. Another major contribution was the onboarding 
              of six team members. I was responsible for bringing them up to speed with various aspects of the project, including the requirements, AutoML web applications, 
              hardware applications, and the overall lifecycle of the edge project, ensuring their readiness for the successful delivery of the pilot project. Moreover, 
              I streamlined MLOps pipelines and was involved in transmitting detailed analyses. 
              These analyses covered a wide spectrum of information, from triggered events and user activities to live insights, which were prominently displayed on Grafana Dashboards.

  description: From May through August, I dedicated my efforts to developing an innovative audio anonymization
               solution tailored for automotive clients. This project culminated in the creation of a Java-based
               lightweight application designed to strip voices of any personally identifiable characteristics. 
               By altering voice signatures to sound unrecognizable, the application significantly enhances privacy, 
               addressing the vulnerability of in-car communications. In vehicles, where phone calls and meetings are 
               often at risk of interception by attackers, this solution plays a crucial role in safeguarding confidential 
               information. For a more detailed exploration of this project, please refer to my blog.
