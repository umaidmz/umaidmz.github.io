**<span style="text-align:left;">Few Shot Learning for Biometric Verification</span>**

 - Built a novel lightweight hybrid neural network architecture using handcrafted and deep features to synthesize a model yielding 91% accuracy on periocular images from UBIPr, 78% on signatures from SigComp with an average of 6% false acceptance rate.

**<span style="text-align:left;">Bitcoin Predictor for Distributed Systems</span>**

 - Used Apache Spark and scala to develop a distributed  end-to-end parsing mechanism on HDFS for information retrieval from bitcoin binary data and inferred future prices using XGBoost and random forest with an accuracy of 60%.

**<span style="text-align:left;">Sketchinator</span>**

 - Constructed a mobile application using IAPR winning sketch classification model with 81% accuracy, utilizing transfer learning and dimensionality reduction, to enhance creativity among young children by 13% with a reward feedback process.

**<span style="text-align:left;">Smart Urban Road Facility (SMURF)</span>**

 - Developed a smart lighting application using Arduino UNO that reduced electricity consumption on highways by 38%  to prevent unnecessary usage of street lights on unused roads.

**<span style="text-align:left;">Synchronized Cloud Repository</span>**

 - Replicated the use case of Github to develop a cloud repository and authenticated user information using POSIX V shared memory thereby seamlessly and securely synchronizing local directories with server file system.

**<span style="text-align:left;">Sample Based Path Planning</span>**

 - Implemented Rapidly Exploring Random Trees module for fast path evaluation for arbitrary host which is specified to be biased towards the goals using probabilistic attraction given by the user.

**<span style="text-align:left;">Garage Proximity Detection System</span>**

 - Implemented a proximity detector on Raspbian OS using Python while utilizing the I/O library for the purpose of sensing obstacles while parking which classifies 3 distinct levels of proximity by lighting red, yellow and green LEDs.
