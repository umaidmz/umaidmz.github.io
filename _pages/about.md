I am a graduate student at University of Waterloo, majoring in Data Science and Artifcial Intelligence with a passion to develop production level machine learning solutions and deploy Machine Learning applications in real world environments. Some of my work includes spatial audio scene recognition, periocular region verification, sketch recognition and more projects viewable on my profile. I strive to never stop learning and stepping out of my comfort zone to learn new skills and grasp knowledge from other fields. A few words to describe myself would be **passionate**, **hard worker**, and **quick learner**.






[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for [my blog](https://www.amitmerchant.com).

This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment.
